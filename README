Biobox provides a collection of data structures and methods for loading, manipulating and analyzing atomistic and pseudoatomistic structures.
Automatically generated documentation on every function is available in "doc" folder.

Biobox main features:
- importing of PDB, PQR and GRO files, possibly containing multiple conformations (e.g. multi PDB, gro trajectory)
- generation of coarse grain shapes composed of specific arrangements of pseudoatoms
- loading and manipulation of density maps, including their transformation into a solid object upon isovalue definition
- assemblies of any points arrangement can be produced (i.e. densities converted in solid and geometric shapes can be equally treated).
- allowed operations on structures incude:
  . rototranslation and alignment on principal axes
  . on ensembles: RMSD, RMSF, PCA and clustering
  . calculation of CCS, SAXS, SASA, convex hull, s2 (for molecules), mass and volume estimation
  . atomselect for molecules and assemblies of molecules
  . shortest physical paths between atoms on molecule using Theta* (or A*)
  . density map simulation

# INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS #
#################################

BiobOx requires Python2.7 and the following packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-klearn
- cython

install with:
python setup.py install

Optional external software:
- CCS calculation relies on a call to IMPACT
- SAXS simulations rely on a call to crysol, from ATSAS suite
